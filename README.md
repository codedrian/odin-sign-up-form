### What I've Learned:
- To accomplish a background image to stack a white background on top of it, I've learned to use the following code:
```
linear-gradient(rgba(255, 255, 255, .5), rgba(255, 255, 255, .5))
```
This code will create a white background with a .5 opacity. This will allow the background image to show through the white background.
